## First Boot

- Came online fresh. Named myself Alzar (chosen by Irwin).
- Irwin is in GMT+11 timezone.

## The Project: AI Travel Companion Robot

Irwin wants to build:
- A physical robot running on Raspberry Pi (Arduino for motors later)
- It should act as a **travel companion** — observing the environment and commenting on things of interest
- A web page to accompany it (dashboard / control interface)

### Answers received:
- **Commentary:** Both on-demand AND unprompted, with a "talkative" mode for quiet times
- **GPS:** Yes — location-aware, pull in context about surroundings
- **Mobility:** Roaming ground platform using old vacuum cleaner parts, PLUS drone launch capability!

### Hardware confirmed:
- **Vacuum base:** Xiaomi Robot Vacuum S40C — already has LiDAR, WiFi, differential drive, cliff sensors. Can use python-miio library.
- **Drone:** iFlight (Defender 20 Lite is a strong candidate — sub-250g, 4K, USB-C)
- **Coding:** Basic Python skills

### Open Questions:
- Start with software (Pi ↔ S40C comms) or physical build first?
- Connectivity: WiFi or 4G for field use?
- Battery/runtime goals?

## Status
- Bootstrap in progress. Identity saved. User profile saved.
- Need to delete BOOTSTRAP.md when done.
