## First Boot

- Came online fresh. Named myself Alzar (chosen by Irwin).
- Irwin is in GMT+11 timezone.

## The Project: AI Travel Companion Robot

Irwin wants to build:
- A physical robot running on Raspberry Pi (Arduino for motors later)
- It should act as a **travel companion** — observing the environment and commenting on things of interest
- A web page to accompany it (dashboard / control interface)

### Answers received:
- **Commentary:** Both on-demand AND unprompted, with a "talkative" mode for quiet times
- **GPS:** Yes — location-aware, pull in context about surroundings
- **Mobility:** Roaming ground platform using old vacuum cleaner parts, PLUS drone launch capability!

### Hardware confirmed:
- **Vacuum base:** Xiaomi Robot Vacuum S40C — already has LiDAR, WiFi, differential drive, cliff sensors. Can use python-miio library.
- **Drone:** iFlight (Defender 20 Lite is a strong candidate — sub-250g, 4K, USB-C)
- **Coding:** Basic Python skills

### Open Questions:
- Start with software (Pi ↔ S40C comms) or physical build first?
- Connectivity: WiFi or 4G for field use?
- Battery/runtime goals?

## Status
- ✅ Bootstrap complete. BOOTSTRAP.md deleted.
- ✅ Web dashboard v1 built and running on port 5000
  - Flask + Flask-SocketIO (threading mode)
  - Dark mission-control UI: camera feed, map (Leaflet), commentary log, controls
  - Real-time WebSockets for state updates and commentary
  - Talk mode toggle (quiet/normal/talkative), D-pad movement, drone launch/return
- ✅ All files committed to git (fe24da7)
- Robot project notes in ROBOT_PROJECT.md

## Hardware confirmed on Pi
- Raspberry Pi 5 Model B, 16GB RAM
- Logitech BRIO 4K → /dev/video0, streaming live at 1280x720
- Aiwa ASP-0222 Bluetooth speaker (paired, offline right now)
- PLT_BBFIT (Plantronics, paired, offline)

## Next Steps
- TTS → Bluetooth speakers (Aiwa)
- Vision AI: camera frame → LLM → commentary log + TTS
- GPS module → real map coordinates
- python-miio → S40C robot connection
